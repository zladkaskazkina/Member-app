## About app
This app is used for user registration to membership in private organisation 'Be Family' (fictional organisation for study purpose).
For frontend I used Vue.js with Vuex a Vue Router. For database and Rest Api backend I used Realtime Database from Firebase. For simple avavtar i used 3rd party Api https://eu.ui-avatars.com/ 

On the home page user have two possibilities: 
1. click on button 'Become a member' and go to registration page, or 
2. click on second button 'All members' an go to the page with list of members

For succesfull registration user has to fill all inputs (firstname, lastname, location, description and areas of experties).

Every user could see the list of members and see the details of every member on separate page. 
Contact form is not ready for this moment and it is the next fiture that will be added to this app.
